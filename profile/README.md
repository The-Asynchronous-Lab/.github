# The Asynchronous Lab 🧠⚙️

Welcome to **The Asynchronous Lab**, a small collective of researchers and builders who love to tinker, learn, and create, asynchronously.

Founded by **[Swayam](https://github.com/SwayamInSync)** and **[Ramneet](https://github.com/Ramneet-Singh)**, this lab is our little digital garage for:

* 🛠️ Building cool open-source projects
* 📚 Hosting reading groups on deep tech and research papers
* 🧪 Experimenting with ideas at the intersection of systems, machine learning, and beyond


## 🌱 What to Expect

* **Open Research & Projects:** Code-first explorations of ideas we find fascinating — from ML systems to Theory to compiler tech, and everything in between.
* **Reading Groups:** Occasionally, we pick a paper (or a topic), dive deep, and document our thoughts, critiques, and implementations.
* **Documentation-Driven:** We try to make our work accessible, well-documented, and easy to contribute to.
* **Async Vibes Only:** We're not about speed, but about depth, we take our time, and we like it that way.
